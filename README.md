# DSA (Data Structures & Algorithms)

This repository contains my personal practice solutions to various Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) problems implemented in **C++**.

The problems are added as I practice regularly, so they are **not strictly ordered or pattern-wise**.  
This repo mainly serves as a learning log and revision space for me.

---

## 🎯 Purpose
- Improve problem-solving and logical thinking
- Practice DSA concepts using C++
- Prepare for coding interviews and assessments
- Track my learning progress over time

---

## 📂 Structure
Problems are loosely organized by topic where possible, such as:
- Arrays
- Binary Search
- Recursion
- Miscellaneous DSA problems

Some problems may be added directly based on what I am practicing at the moment.

---

## 🛠 Language & Tools
- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** GCC
- **Editor:** VS Code
- **Platform:** Linux

---

## 📌 Notes
- Solutions focus on clarity and correctness
- Code may be refactored or optimized later as I learn more

---

## 🚧 Status
This repository is **ongoing** and will be updated as I continue practicing DSA.
